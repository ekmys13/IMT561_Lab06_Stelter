Folder: src - short for "Source"
- Create this file to put your python scripts for streamlit in there

Python files to go in the src folder ("source code"):
- charts.py --> where you have visualization functions
- data.py --> where you're reading in & transforming your data (after cleaning & preprocessing, sounds like)
- filters.py --> rendering & sticking visualizations into the dashboard

General Takeaways:
- You're building & testing graphs in the Jupyter notebook before creating the Python scripts
- Seems like a good idea to have honestly an entirely separate notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing
- And then you can save to updated csv files and create a new notebook for visualization building

Questions about Streamlit:
- How do you make multiple views of a dataset? Like how do you create a toggle filter for stuff?
---> Sounds like this is in filters.py

Streamlit documentation
- Just read through layout documentation & where you can actually put stuff
